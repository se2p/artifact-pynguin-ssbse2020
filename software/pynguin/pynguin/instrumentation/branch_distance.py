    When calling a method on an object, the arguments have to be on top of the stack.
    In most cases, we need to rotate the items on the stack with ROT_THREE or ROT_FOUR
    to reorder the elements accordingly.

    A POP_TOP instruction is required after calling a method, because each method
    implicitly returns None."""

        We only transform the underlying bytecode cfg, by partially unrolling the first

        The first block is called, if the iterator on which the loop is based
        yields at least one element, in which case we report the boolean value True
        to the tracer, leave the yielded value of the iterator on top of the stack and
        jump to the the regular body of the loop.

        The second block is called, if the iterator on which the loop is based
        does not yield an element, in which case we report the boolean value False
        to the tracer and jump to the exit instruction of the loop.

        The third block acts as the new internal header of the for loop. It consists
        of a copy of the original "FOR_ITER" instruction of the loop.

        The original loop header is changed such that it either falls through to the first
        block or jumps to the second, if no element is yielded.

        Since Python is a structured programming language, there can be no jumps
        directly into the loop that bypass the loop header (e.g., GOTO).
        Jumps which reach the loop header from outside the loop will still target
        the original loop header, so they don't need to be modified.
        Jumps which originate from within the loop (e.g., break or continue) need
        to be redirected to the new internal header (3rd new block).
