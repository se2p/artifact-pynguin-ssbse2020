## REQUIREMENTS
Very few! Just:

- Python3
- Git

The list of dependencies is shown in `./requirements.txt`, however the installer takes care of installing them for you.

## INSTALL

Installing PyDriller is easily done using pip. Assuming it is installed, just run the following from the command-line:

```
pip install pydriller
```
This will also install the necessary dependencies.

## SOURCE CODE

If you like to clone from source, you can do it with very simple steps.
First, clone the repo:

```
> git clone https://github.com/ishepard/pydriller.git
> cd pydriller
```

### OPTIONAL

It is suggested to make use of `virtualenv`:

```
> virtualenv -p python3 venv
> source venv/bin/activate
```

### INSTALL THE REQUIREMENTS AND RUN THE TESTS

Install pydriller and the requirements:

```
> python setup.py install
```

to run the tests (using pytest):

```
> unzip test-repos.zip
> pytest
```


## TUTORIAL
For information on how to use PyDriller, refer to the official documentation:

- [http://pydriller.readthedocs.io](http://pydriller.readthedocs.io)
- a video on Youtube: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Oui4bP9eN8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Oui4bP9eN8)

## How to contribute
Fork the project and follow the instructions on how to get started with [source code](#source-code). I tend to not accept a Pull Request without tests, so:

- unzip the `test-repos.zip` zip file
- inside you will find many "small repositories" that I manually created to test PyDriller. Choose the one you prefer the most, and test your feature (check the tests I have already written, you'll find inspiration there)
- if you do not find a repository that is suitable to test your feature, create a new one. **Be careful**: if you create a new one, do not forget to upload a new zip file `test-repos.zip` that includes your new repository, otherwise the tests will fail.
